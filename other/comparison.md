# ðŸ™Œ Comparison

People might be curious about how we differ from mainstream DEX Farming. Here are some comparisons with Thunder Finance and STON.fi farming:

1. **Permissionless**: At Thunder Finance, any project team can create their Farming Pool through our UI without needing permission. However, at Ston Finance, project teams cannot independently create farming pools through their interface.
2. **Flexibility**: At Thunder Finance, project teams can open pools that allow users to deposit any type of token, offering greater flexibility. This means we support not only the original LP tokens from Ston Finance and Dedust, but we can also accommodate common practices in new projects, such as staking A to earn A or staking A's LP to earn A. In contrast, Ston only allows rewards for their own LP tokens.
3. **Traffic Generation**: At Thunder Finance, we provide event-based yield farming, acting more as a traffic generation platform between users and projects. As a bridge connecting different projects and users, our platform offers project teams the opportunity to reach new users. Through our whitelist mechanism, we ensure users can explore more high-quality alpha under our supervision. However, at Ston, they can only direct users to the block explorer. This is why Ian from Ton Foundation said they want to use us as the official promotion medium for The Open League, replacing their TOL Bot.
4. **Collaboration**: Our platform has a certain degree of collaboration with Ston and Dedust. Users can provide liquidity to these two exchanges through our app, and Thunder Finance gives project teams the authority to adjust the reward weights of different pools over time, allowing them to easily implement their reward strategies and unlock more gameplay options.
5. **User Experience**: Thunder Finance excels in gas optimization, addressing the common issue of high transaction costs on Ston, resulting in lower friction costs and a better user experience.
6. **Traffic**: To be honest, because Thunder Finance is just starting, our traffic and community are much smaller compared to Ston. However, we are actively preparing events with Tonstarter and Ton Foundation to expand our community scale.
