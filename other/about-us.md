       Tic Ton oracle stands as proactive oracle on the TON blockchain. Diverging from market-standard final prices set by price providers, it employs Game Theory to craft a decentralized network of non-cooperative games. This network ascertains the ultimate price via mechanisms of arbitrage and bidirectional options, incorporating the chain with random data from decentralized price streams.
5. **TON Hacker House 2024**
   *   [**Thunder Mint**](https://arc.net/l/quote/ljyvnzni) **( Third Place ü•â )**

       With just a click, project creators can launch their own liquidity mining pools, rewarding users with platform tokens for their LP tokens, enhancing DEX liquidity through incentive mechanisms. Plus, our seamless one-click token creation and airdrop distribution via Merkle Distributor make entering the TON blockchain easy for everyone.
