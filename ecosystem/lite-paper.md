## Introduction

Thunder finance is a one-stop yield farming solution on TON blockchain. It enables project owners to create their own farming pools to incentivize users securely and easily while preventing sell pressure. Users can benefit from farming rewards. Moreover, Thunder Finance is more than just a simple yield farming platform; it also serves as a traffic redirection platform and a liquidity aggregation portal.&#x20;

### Event-based Yield Farming Platform

We have adopted a special event-based yield farming approach that is particularly suitable for projects looking to host economic incentive events. Project owners can create a farm where the interface displays detailed information about the event and links to the project. They simply need to deposit the reward tokens and specify the event's duration to easily initiate the activity. Then, by simply specifying the types of tokens to reward and their corresponding weights, multiple yield farming pools can be easily created. Once the event starts, rewards are automatically distributed every second to different pools according to their weights, attracting users while also enhancing their loyalty to the project and increasing the project's liquidity.

### Passive Earning Management

Compared to other farming platforms, we offer users additional yield management tools, allowing them to assess their APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and ROA (Return on Assets). This enables users to make economic decisions aimed at maximizing their benefits based on statistical data.

### Traffic Redirection Platform

The combination of event-based yield farming and a white-listing mechanism inherently makes us a platform for traffic redirection. Projects on the whitelist are voted on by the governing body based on the project's solutions, vision, and team composition (note: before governance is transferred to the DAO, this process is facilitated by core members of Thunder Finance). Projects that appear on the whitelist are more attractive to users. Coupled with the event-based project introduction interface, project owners can more easily reach different customer segments and expand their user base.

### Liquidity Aggregation Portal

We have integrated the two largest DEXs on TON: Ston Finance and Dedust, making us a sufficient liquidity aggregation portal. Our platform introduces the innovative Thunder Deposit feature, which spares users the time of switching between different dapps, allowing them to provide liquidity to Ston Finance and Dedust directly through Thunder Finance. After testing and ensuring stability, users will even be able to provide liquidity with just a single currency (for example, by holding only USDT, they can supply liquidity to TON/USDT), greatly increasing convenience.

## Philosophy

The initial intention of Thunder Finance was to stimulate the Total Value Locked (TVL) across the entire TON blockchain and to encourage more project owners to invest more time in the development and innovation of business logic. Thunder Finance aims to become a community-oriented, systemic module exclusive to the TON ecosystem, ultimately driven and governed by the community. To realize this philosophy, in the next phase of our product, we will introduce a DAO module and have applied some 'magic' to the tokenomics, allowing the community to choose between greater returns or more governance power.

## Target Segment

### DeFi Protocols

DeFi protocols particularly rely on high liquidity to ensure efficient and cost-effective transactions. Yield farming incentivizes users to provide liquidity, such as by depositing tokens into liquidity pools, where they can earn additional rewards like tokens or interest. This significantly increases the amount of capital within the protocol, making transactions faster and less costly.

### GameFi

#### Creating Economic Incentives

Yield farming can provide strong economic incentives to attract new players and encourage existing ones to continue participating. Players can earn passive income through simple investment activities, which helps build loyalty and long-term engagement.

#### Promoting Community Building and Brand Loyalty

Through reward farming, GameFi projects can establish an actively participating community, where players are not only users of the game but also sharers in its profits. This enhances their sense of investment in the project and brand loyalty.

### Meme token&#x20;

#### Maintaining Interest and Value

Since the value of meme coins is largely driven by community interest and network effects, continuous rewards can keep the community active and focused on the meme coins. This helps to maintain and even enhance their market value.

#### Community Building and Marketing Tool

Yield farming can also serve as a marketing strategy, using reward mechanisms to promote community growth and engagement. This strategy can help meme coin projects stand out in a competitive market.

## Tokenomics

<mark style="color:yellow;">We will issue the T token as the platform's token. This "T" stands for TON, for Telegram, and most significantly, for Thunder Finance. This symbol embodies the philosophy of Thunder Finance as a community-driven ecosystem product.</mark>

Thunder Finance's token Symbol: `T`  plays a crucial role, as holders can choose to stake T tokens to obtain GoT for governance rights, or place T in a special T Token liquidity mining pool to earn more T tokens.

Total supply: `100,000,000`

### Allocation

* `Team` 17%
* `Advisors` 3%
* `Reserve` 5%
* `Governance` 12%
* `Private Sale` 10%
* `IDO` 5%
* `Liquidity` 48%

#### Team & Advisors (20%)

Allocated for team members and developer salaries.

Unlock schedule: Linearly over 4 years.

#### Reserve (5%)

Reserved for future use.

#### Governance (12%, soon to be completed)

Users can stake T tokens to receive GoT tokens, with longer staking periods yielding more GoT tokens.

GoT tokens allow participation in platform voting, with future control over:

1. The amount of T tokens required to open a pool (currently 0).
2. The fee percentage collected from project owners when opening pools (currently 0.3%).
3. The sharing of protocol revenues.
4. The frequency and amount of T tokens repurchased from the market for destruction.

Holders of GoT tokens receive 10% of the total T tokens as a governance fee.

Unlock schedule: Exponentially decreasing over 6 years, incentivizing early governance participation.

#### Liquidity (48%)

*   **Maintaining market liquidity (20%)**

    Unlock schedule: Linearly over 5 years.
*   **Marketing (8%)**

    Marketing is primarily used for stimulating community engagement, events, advertisements, promotions, etc.

    3% of the total will be released initially for events and airdrops.

    An additional 5% will be linearly unlocked over 3 years:

    1. Funding community development of applications using Thunder Finance.
    2. Maintaining long-term partnerships with strategic partners.
*   **Yield Farming (20%)**

    Users can place their T tokens in a special liquidity mining pool to farm more T tokens.

    Unlock schedule: Linearly over 5 years.
